Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use PKSNavigation for stack-based navigation:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import PKSNavigation

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var navigationManager = PKSNavigationManager()

    var body: some View {
        PKSNavigationContainer(navigationManager: navigationManager) {
            HomeView()
        }
    }
}

struct HomeView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var navigationManager: PKSNavigationManager

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Home View")
                .font(.largeTitle)
            Button("Go to Detail in Stack") {
                navigationManager.navigate(to: RootPages.detail)
            }

            Button("Go to Detail on Sheet") {
                navigationManager.navigate(to: RootPages.detail, presentation: .sheet)
            }

            Button("Go to Detail in Stack") {
                navigationManager.navigate(to: RootPages.detail, presentation: .cover)
            }
        }
    }
}

struct DetailView: View {
    @Environment(\.pksDismiss) var dismiss

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Detail View")
                .font(.largeTitle)
            Button("Go Back") {
                dismiss()
            }
        }
    }
}

// Define your pages conforming to PKSPage
enum RootPages: PKSPage {
    case detail

    var description: String {
        switch self {
        case detail:
            return "Detail Page"
        }
    }

    @ViewBuilder
    var body: some View {
        switch self {
        case detail:
            DetailView()
        }
    }
}
```
